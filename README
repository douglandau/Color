Color
=====

Color is a colormap watcher and editor for 8 bit PseudoColor visuals,
with a Motif GUI

Color displays a 16x16 matrix of swatches like xcmap, each representing
one of the 256 cells, and adds :
- the ability to select one of the swatches
- two new panes:
  - first new pane has three sliders adjusting the red green 
    and blue components of the selected colorcell 
  - second new pane has a larger swatch of the color for easier viewing.  
- a "Black out free cells" button
- a log of all events to happen to the cmap
- a status line showing:
  - the number of free cells
  - the status of the elected cell

Color was developed to help debug a application attempting to 
display an image on a Sun Sparc with a 256 PseudoColor visual.

Color polls the cmap for its contents every N seconds and updates
the display.  The way to use it therefore is:

1.  Run it
2.  Click "Black out free cells"
3.  Load up the cmap with xli or xwud or your app 

You will see exactly which cells are being gobbled up.

Color's behavior when run against other visuals (DirectColor, TrueColor, etc) 
is undefined.
